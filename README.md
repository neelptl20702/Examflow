üìù ExamFlow - Exam Scheduling & Management Tool

ExamFlow is a web-based application designed to streamline the process of scheduling exams, managing subjects, rooms, faculty, creating seating arrangements, and assigning invilation duties.

‚û°Ô∏è Live Demo: You can try ExamFlow live here!

Motivation: This project was developed as a personal initiative by me at the School of Computer Science, Engineering and Technology at ITM SLS Baroda University to address the complexities and manual effort involved in the exam scheduling process, aiming for a more efficient and organized workflow.

üíæ Data Management Notes

All data (exam details, subjects, schedule, rooms, faculty, allotments, duties) is stored in the browser's localStorage. This means the data is specific to the browser you are using.

It is highly recommended to use the Save Data button regularly to create a JSON backup file. This allows you to:

Transfer your work to another computer or browser.

Recover your data if localStorage gets cleared.

The Load Data button will overwrite all current data with the content from the selected JSON file.

The Clear All button removes all data from localStorage and reloads the application. Use with caution!
